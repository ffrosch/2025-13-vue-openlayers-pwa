| FR001          | Add Website as PWA                    | As a user, I want to be able to add the Website as a PWA on my mobile device.                                                                     | The system should provide the ability to add the Website as a PWA on mobile devices.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| FR002          | Configure storage persistence         | As a user, I want to be sure that my local data won't be deleted.                                                                                 | The website should have a settings section, where type of storage can be toggled between persistent and non-persistent. A warning symbol should be displayed conditionally in the settings button and in front of the toggle switch if the storage is not persistent. |
| FR003          | Implement IndexedDB for local storage | As a user, I want to be able to store tiles and collected field data offline.                                                                     | The website should offer to store selected areas/tiles and automatically store, synchronize and invalidate all relevant data                                                                                                                                          |
| FR004          | Export / Backup data                  | As a user, I want to be able to save the data in the file system, to prevent data loss due to accidental incognito mode, wiped website data, etc. | The website should have a possibility that lets the user export all data entries (no tiles!) from the IndexedDB to json.                                                                                                                                              |
