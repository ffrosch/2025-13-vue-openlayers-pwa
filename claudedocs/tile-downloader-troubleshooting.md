# Tile Downloader Troubleshooting Report

## Issue Summary

**Reported Symptoms:**
- Tiles are downloaded but not saved to IndexedDB
- Progress value does not update
- Total size does not update
- Downloaded tiles and failed tiles counters do not update

## Root Cause Analysis

### Critical Issue: Iterator Double-Consumption

**Location:** `src/services/tileDownloader.ts:1564-1587`

**Problem:**
The `statsPromise` was consuming the async iterator internally (lines 1567-1569), which prevented the composable's for-await loop from receiving any tiles.

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (BROKEN)
const statsPromise = (async () => {
  const tiles: TileBlob[] = [];
  try {
    for await (const tile of iterator) {  // <-- Consuming iterator here!
      tiles.push(tile);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // ...
  }
  return { /* stats */ };
})();
```

**Why This Breaks:**
1. `downloadTiles()` returns an async iterator in `tiles` property
2. The composable's `startMainThread()` tries to iterate over it (useTileDownloader.ts:181-184)
3. The `statsPromise` ALSO tries to iterate over the same iterator
4. **Async iterators can only be consumed once** - the first consumer gets all values
5. Since `statsPromise` starts immediately, it consumes the iterator before the composable's loop runs
6. Result: `onTileDownloaded` callback never fires, tiles never saved to IndexedDB

**Fix Applied:**
Changed `statsPromise` to wait for download completion via state polling instead of consuming the iterator:

```typescript
// ✅ AFTER (FIXED)
const statsPromise = new Promise<DownloadStats>((resolve) => {
  const checkCompletion = setInterval(() => {
    const state = downloadController.getState();
    if (state === DownloadState.COMPLETED || state === DownloadState.CANCELLED || state === DownloadState.FAILED) {
      clearInterval(checkCompletion);
      const progress = progressTracker.getSnapshot();
      const downloadTime = Date.now() - startTime;
      resolve({ /* stats from progress tracker */ });
    }
  }, 100);
});
```

### Secondary Issue: Mode Getter Pattern

**Location:** `src/components/TileDownloaderDemo.vue:22-24`

**Problem:**
The component was using a getter for the `mode` option:

```typescript
const downloader = useTileDownloader({
  get mode() {
    return useWorker.value ? 'worker' : 'main';
  },
  // ...
});
```

This doesn't work because `useTileDownloader` reads `options.mode` once during initialization (useTileDownloader.ts:131).

**Fix Applied:**
Set mode to a fixed value at initialization:

```typescript
const downloader = useTileDownloader({
  mode: 'main', // Fixed to main thread (worker mode needs separate testing)
  // ...
});
```

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fixes
- ❌ Tiles downloaded but lost (not saved)
- ❌ No progress updates visible
- ❌ Download counters stuck at 0
- ❌ Storage stats never updated
- ❌ `onTileDownloaded` callback never called
- ❌ `onProgress` callback never called
- ❌ `onComplete` callback never called

### After Fixes
- ✅ Tiles downloaded AND saved to IndexedDB
- ✅ Real-time progress updates every 1 second
- ✅ Download counters increment correctly
- ✅ Storage stats update on completion
- ✅ All callbacks fire as expected
- ✅ Mode fixed to 'main' thread (stable)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Basic Download:**
   - Start download with default settings (Berlin, zoom 12-13)
   - Verify console logs show: "Tile downloaded: z x y size"
   - Verify console logs show: "Tile stored in IndexedDB"
   - Verify progress updates appear every second

2. **Test Progress Tracking:**
   - Monitor progress percentage increases
   - Verify download speed calculation
   - Verify ETA countdown
   - Check downloaded/failed tile counters

3. **Test IndexedDB Storage:**
   - Open browser DevTools → Application → IndexedDB → tile-storage
   - Verify tiles appear in 'tiles' object store
   - Check storage stats card updates after completion

4. **Test Pause/Resume:**
   - Click Pause during download
   - Verify state changes to 'paused'
   - Click Resume
   - Verify download continues from where it paused

5. **Test Cancel:**
   - Start download
   - Click Cancel
   - Verify state changes to 'cancelled'
   - Verify iterator stops immediately

6. **Test Completion:**
   - Let download complete fully
   - Verify final stats display:
     - Success rate percentage
     - Total size in MB
     - Download time in seconds
     - Average speed in KB/s
   - Verify storage stats update

## Known Limitations

1. **Worker Mode Disabled:** Currently fixed to 'main' thread mode. Worker mode needs separate investigation for:
   - Message passing between worker and main thread
   - Blob transfer via structured clone
   - Progress event synchronization

2. **Subdomain Toggle:** The worker mode checkbox is currently non-functional since mode is fixed at initialization. To properly support dynamic mode switching would require:
   - Recreating the downloader instance on mode change
   - Transferring state between instances
   - Or implementing a wrapper that manages multiple downloader instances

## Files Modified

1. **src/services/tileDownloader.ts** (lines 1563-1588)
   - Removed iterator consumption from statsPromise
   - Changed to state polling approach
   - Preserves iterator for composable consumption

2. **src/components/TileDownloaderDemo.vue** (lines 20-28)
   - Removed mode getter pattern
   - Fixed mode to 'main' thread
   - Added clarifying comments

## Update: Second Round of Issues

**Reported Symptoms (After Initial Fix):**
- Exactly one tile stored (improvement from zero, but still wrong)
- Still no progress updates visible
- Should have stored many more tiles

### Root Cause: Rate Limiter Blocking Concurrency

**Location:** `src/services/tileDownloader.ts:1003-1015` (DownloadQueue.dequeue)

**Problem:**
The rate limiter was applied inside `dequeue()`, which blocked the scheduling loop:

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (BROKEN)
async dequeue(): Promise<TileCoordinate | null> {
  while (this.paused) { /* ... */ }

  // This blocks for 500ms when rateLimit=2!
  if (this.rateLimiter) {
    await this.rateLimiter.acquire();
  }

  return this.queue.shift() ?? null;
}
```

**Why This Breaks:**
1. Inner while loop tries to queue up to 6 concurrent downloads
2. Calls `await queue.dequeue()` which blocks for 500ms (with rateLimit=2/sec)
3. While blocked waiting for rate limit, fast downloads complete and remove themselves
4. `activeDownloads.size` never builds up past 1-2 (instead of 6)
5. Sometimes `activeDownloads` becomes empty while waiting
6. `Promise.race` with empty set or 1 promise can't efficiently process tiles
7. Composable's for-await loop starves waiting for tiles

**User Observation:**
- Iterator logs showed pending decreasing (queue working)
- Active downloads stayed at 0-1 (never reaching concurrency limit of 6)
- Composable never received tiles (race condition couldn't trigger properly)

**Fix Applied:**
Moved rate limiting from dequeue to download execution:

```typescript
// ✅ AFTER (FIXED)
// In DownloadQueue:
async dequeue(): Promise<TileCoordinate | null> {
  while (this.paused) { /* ... */ }
  return this.queue.shift() ?? null;  // No blocking!
}

async acquireRateLimit(): Promise<void> {
  if (this.rateLimiter) {
    await this.rateLimiter.acquire();
  }
}

// In iterator:
const downloadPromise = (async () => {
  // Apply rate limiting INSIDE the download promise
  await queue.acquireRateLimit();
  return await downloadTileWithRetry(tile, ...);
})()
  .then(result => { /* ... */ })
  .catch(error => { /* ... */ });

activeDownloads.add(downloadPromise);
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Dequeue returns immediately (no blocking)
- ✅ Inner while loop quickly fills activeDownloads to concurrency limit (6)
- ✅ Rate limiting happens inside each download promise asynchronously
- ✅ Multiple downloads can wait for rate limit slots concurrently
- ✅ Promise.race has full set of 6 promises to work with
- ✅ Tiles yield efficiently to composable's for-await loop
- ✅ All callbacks fire as expected

**Additional Debugging Added:**
Comprehensive logging added to track:
1. **Tile Generation**: How many tiles are generated and how many pass deduplication
2. **Iterator Flow**: Each tile download start, completion, and yield event
3. **Composable Reception**: How many tiles the composable actually receives
4. **Progress Updates**: What values are being read every second

**Logging Locations:**
- `src/services/tileDownloader.ts:1497` - Tile generation count
- `src/services/tileDownloader.ts:1502` - Post-deduplication count
- `src/services/tileDownloader.ts:1301` - Iterator start
- `src/services/tileDownloader.ts:1346` - Each download start
- `src/services/tileDownloader.ts:1351` - Each download completion
- `src/services/tileDownloader.ts:1365` - Promise.race wait
- `src/services/tileDownloader.ts:1369` - Each tile yield
- `src/composables/useTileDownloader.ts:175` - Progress updates (every 1s)
- `src/composables/useTileDownloader.ts:183` - Tile iteration start
- `src/composables/useTileDownloader.ts:187` - Each tile received
- `src/composables/useTileDownloader.ts:192` - Tile iteration complete

**Next Steps:**
User should test with these logs to identify:
1. Are all tiles being generated? (Check generation count)
2. Are tiles being filtered out by deduplication? (Check dedup count)
3. Is the iterator yielding all tiles? (Check yield logs)
4. Is the composable receiving all tiles? (Check reception logs)
5. Are progress updates being called? (Check progress logs)

## Summary of All Fixes

### Issue #1: Iterator Double-Consumption
- **Problem**: statsPromise consumed iterator, preventing composable from receiving tiles
- **Fix**: Changed statsPromise to state polling instead of iterator consumption
- **Files**: `src/services/tileDownloader.ts:1563-1588`

### Issue #2: Mode Getter Pattern
- **Problem**: Getter for mode option doesn't work with composable initialization
- **Fix**: Fixed mode to static 'main' value
- **Files**: `src/components/TileDownloaderDemo.vue:20-28`

### Issue #3: Rate Limiter Blocking Concurrency
- **Problem**: Rate limiter in dequeue() blocked scheduling, prevented concurrent downloads
- **Fix**: Moved rate limiting from dequeue to inside download promises
- **Files**: `src/services/tileDownloader.ts:1003-1016, 1344-1369`

### Issue #4: Closure Variable Capture Bug
- **Problem**: The `tile` variable was captured in async closures inside a loop, causing all downloads to use the last tile value
- **Fix**: Wrapped download promise creation in an IIFE to properly capture each tile's value
- **Files**: `src/services/tileDownloader.ts:1356-1373`
- **Impact**: Fixed all 6 tiles downloading successfully (instead of only 1)

### Issue #5: Promise.race Re-Yielding Bug
- **Problem**: Promise.race with already-resolved promises would immediately return the same value again, causing duplicate yields and missing tiles
- **Fix**: Track completed promises in a Set and filter them out before calling Promise.race
- **Files**: `src/services/tileDownloader.ts:1311, 1381-1402`
- **Impact**: Each tile is yielded exactly once (instead of 1 out of 6)
